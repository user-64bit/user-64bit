## 🚀 My Digital Playground 🎮

- 🎁 [DAOnation](https://github.com/user-64bit/DAOnation) - Like "Buy me a coffee" but make it Web3! Tip your favorite creators with crypto magic.

- 🗳️ [PollChain](https://github.com/user-64bit/poll-chain) - Democracy for the digital age. Vote on stuff without worrying about sneaky ballot-stuffers!

- 📝 [suchi](https://github.com/user-64bit/suchi) - For when your thoughts are too precious for regular note apps. Rust-powered CLI for the terminal junkies.

- 📓 [Notebook](https://github.com/user-64bit/notebook) - I made my own Notion because... why not? All the organizational goodness without the subscription fees.

- 🤖 [Wallet-GPT](https://github.com/user-64bit/wallet-gpt) - "Hey AI, send 0.1 ETH to Dave" and boom! It's done. Your crypto wallet with an AI secretary.

- 🧭 [CryptoCompass](https://github.com/user-64bit/CryptoCompass) - Lost in the crypto wilderness? This app helps you track your digital treasure across the blockchain seas.

- 💻 [CodeRunner](https://github.com/user-64bit/CodeRunner) - Write code, hit run, watch magic happen. No setup required, just pure coding dopamine hits.

- 🎨 [Tailwind Site](https://github.com/user-64bit/Website-Clone-Tailwind) - Made a pretty website with pure Tailwind CSS, because sometimes I like to torture myself with utility classes.

- 🃏 [FlashCards](https://github.com/user-64bit/Flashcards) - For when your brain needs help remembering stuff. Flashcards: the original RAM upgrade for humans.

- 💬 [ChatRoom using Socket](https://github.com/user-64bit/ChatRoom-Using-Socket-Programming-in-Python) - Old-school chat room vibes with a CLI. Because GUIs are overrated (sometimes).

- 🎵 [Streamify](https://github.com/user-64bit/Streamify) - Not-Spotify that looks like Spotify but isn't Spotify. Legal teams, please don't @ me.

- 🐙 [Get Git](https://github.com/user-64bit/Get-Git) - Stalk your favorite developers in style! GitHub profiles never looked this good.

- ⏰ [Job-not-finished](https://github.com/user-64bit/job-not-finished) - The digital equivalent of your mom asking why you haven't finished what you started.

- 🧬 [Don't Die Agent](https://github.com/user-64bit/dd-agent) - Bryan Johnson spent millions not to die. I made an app. We are not the same.
